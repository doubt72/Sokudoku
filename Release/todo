- Simplify graphing view render:

Currently it does way too much; some of the complexity could be
abstracted a bit.  Graph types are confusing and arbitray, and it does
too much of its own calculations (not to mention the calculations are
repeated in several other places, e.g., the statistics shown at the
bottom of the main page).  The "histogram" (character window) could
probably use similar simplification, but it isn't as extreme.

- Render a different font for Hangul:

Because of rendering errors in the Hangul system font under OSX 10.8.
Might not be a bad idea to make this configurable for different packages?

- Unit tests

While some of the interface can't be so easily tested, a lot of the
low-level functions certainly could be.

- Color blind settings

Might be nice to have an option to use colors other than red-green for
character display and or graphs.

- More sophisticated error detection

Might be nice to determin where exactly in the answer an error occurs
and penalize that character only.

1. Simplify graphing view render:

Currently it does way too much; some of the complexity could be
abstracted a bit.  Graph types are confusing and arbitray, and it does
too much of its own calculations (not to mention the calculations are
repeated in several other places, e.g., the statistics shown at the
bottom of the main page).  The "histogram" (character window) could
probably use similar simplification, but it isn't as extreme.

2. Return answers for missed characters:

First, this is helpful, but also (at least) the 0xB5xx UTF code page
(Hangul) contains rendering errors in the default system font under
OSX 10.8, so you're for those the drills are showing incorrect
characters -- it'd be nice if I could identify those more easily.

3. Render a different font for Hangul:

Because of rendering errors in the Hangul system font under OSX 10.8.
Or even make this configurable for different packages?

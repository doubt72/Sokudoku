Changes from Version 1.0 (alpha) 2013/3/16

- Switched weighting from linear to squared (Slower characters now
  show up more often during drills)
- Drill no longer repeats characters (But don't try drilling on single
  character sets)
- Changed repetitions per day (wrong) to characters per day (correct)
- Now remembers graph window settings after closing
- Now remembers package settings when switching packages
- Adds confirmation for missed characters (So that if a character is
  missed, it can be checked)
- Added display for averages (per character, per day) over time
- Fixed bug where labels did not match sliders
- Fixed bug where settings weren't reset when changing packages
- Fixed bug where data set isn't reset when changing packages

Changes from Version 1.0 (beta) 2013/3/20

- Refactored/simplified handling of incorrect answers/events and
  timing (so that the time penalty doesn't show up in graphs as time
  studied)
- Added display of correct answer for incorrect drill answers (and
  related option for displaying only non-literal answers)
- Changed internal "speed" value from 5s to 10s for undrilled
  characters (thus making them four times more likely to be drilled on
  over previously drilled characters when drilling by weight).
- Changed anonymous function calls to have named parameters
- Switched to top 150 characters instead of 100 in character view
- Added color coding for character view based on percent correct
  answers
- Added two graphs, one for rate of incorrect answers, one for total
  answers overlaid with rates

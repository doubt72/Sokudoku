# SpeedKana

## What Is It?

An OSX program for practicing reading random Japanese kana.

How will it work?  It displays some characters, you read them and type
in the pronunciation as fast as you can manage, it times you, keeps
track of how fast you do it, and optionally feeds you the characters
you have the most trouble with.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Fairly
simple, really.

## How Do I Build It?

Pop it into XCode, build it.  I suppose at some point I'll have an
.app or .dmg or some shiznit you can grab.  Like, maybe after I
actually write the damned thing.

## License

I'll almost certainly Apache-fy this at some point, but at the moment
I'm just getting it started.  So Copyright 2013 Douglas Triggs

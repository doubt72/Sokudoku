# SpeedKana

## What is It?

An OSX program for practicing reading random Japanese kana.

How will it work?  It displays some characters, you read them and type
in the pronunciation as fast as you can manage, it times you, keeps
track of how fast you do it, and optionally feeds you the characters
you have the most trouble with.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Fairly
simple, really.
